## Configuration

In your `.env` file, make sure you have the following values set.

```bash
TRACECAT__AUTH_TYPES=oidc
OIDC_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>
OIDC_DISCOVERY_URL=<your-provider-discovery-url>
```

## Instructions

1. Configure an OpenID Connect application in your identity provider.
2. Set the environment variables above with the client credentials and discovery URL.
3. Restart Tracecat to apply the changes.

The login page will display an **OpenID Connect** button when `oidc` is listed in `TRACECAT__AUTH_TYPES`.
