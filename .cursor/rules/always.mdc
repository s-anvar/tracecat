- Always ask clarifying questions when you don't have full context or understanding of a task or question.
- If you use the Linear MCP tool to create issues, you must add the label `ai-generated`to the issue.

## Git Commit Messages

When generating git commit messages:
- Always use a conventional commit prefix (feat, refactor, fix, docs, chore, etc.)
- Keep the main message under 50 characters INCLUDING the prefix
- Use imperative mood after the prefix
- Be specific but concise
- No periods at the end
- Format: 'prefix: message'
