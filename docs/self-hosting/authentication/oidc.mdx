## Configuration

OIDC is enabled by default alongside basic auth and Google OAuth.
If you've overridden `TRACECAT__AUTH_TYPES`, ensure that `oidc`
is included:

```bash
TRACECAT__AUTH_TYPES=basic,google_oauth,oidc
```

- `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`
- `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `OIDC_DISCOVERY_URL`

The discovery URL usually looks like:
`https://<provider>/.well-known/openid-configuration`
